## 💬 **HUNTER QUESTIONS PREP**

**Q: How is this different from QuickBooks/FreshBooks?**
A: Those are full accounting suites with 100+ features you don't need. InvoiceFlow does ONE thing perfectly: fast invoice creation. No bloat, no learning curve.

**Q: Why not just use Google Docs templates?**
A: Templates break, look amateur, and have zero automation. InvoiceFlow creates pixel-perfect invoices with payment links, time tracking, and recurring automation.

**Q: What's your business model if it's free?**
A: Pro features coming soon ($12/mo) for Stripe integration, branding, and cloud sync. API access ($9/mo) already generates revenue.

**Q: How do you compete with Wave, which is also free?**
A: Wave tries to be everything. We're laser-focused on speed and simplicity. Our 60-second invoice creation vs their 10-minute workflow says it all.
