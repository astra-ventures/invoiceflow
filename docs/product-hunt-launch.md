## 💬 First Comment (Maker Post)

Hey Product Hunt community! 👋

I'm excited to launch **InvoiceFlow** — a completely free invoice generator that works instantly in your browser with zero friction.

**The problem:** Every invoice tool I tried required signups, monthly fees, or stored my sensitive business data on their servers. As a freelancer, I just wanted to create professional invoices quickly without the overhead.

**The solution:** InvoiceFlow works entirely in your browser with local storage. No accounts, no data collection, no monthly fees. Just open it, create beautiful invoices, and go.

**What makes it special:**
✅ **Zero friction** — No signups, no onboarding, works instantly  
✅ **Privacy-first** — Your data never leaves your device  
✅ **Professional results** — Beautiful templates that look great  
✅ **Built-in time tracking** — Perfect for hourly work  
✅ **Payment integration** — Stripe payment links (Pro tier)  
✅ **Recurring invoices** — Automate monthly billing  
✅ **Completely free** — Core features always free  

I built this because I was frustrated with existing solutions. Sometimes you just need to invoice a client quickly without jumping through hoops or worrying about data privacy.

**Try it now:** No download, no signup — just go to the link and start creating invoices immediately.

Would love your feedback! What features would make your invoicing workflow even better?
