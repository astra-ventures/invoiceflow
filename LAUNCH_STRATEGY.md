🚀 LAUNCHING: InvoiceFlow on Product Hunt!

After watching freelancers waste 10+ minutes creating invoices in bloated software, I built something different:

Professional invoices in 60 seconds. No signup required.

🧵 Why existing solutions suck + what we built instead...

[Thread continues with build story, screenshots, link to PH]
```

### LinkedIn Professional Post:
```
After years of using overcomplicated invoice software, I built InvoiceFlow - a tool that creates professional invoices in under 60 seconds.

No signup walls, no feature bloat, just fast invoice generation.

We're launching on Product Hunt today. Here's what makes it different... [professional version of the story]
```

2. **Popular hunters with good launch success**

### Outreach Template:
```
Hi [Name],

I'm launching InvoiceFlow on Product Hunt next week - a tool that creates professional invoices in 60 seconds (no signup required).

I've been following your launches and love how you [specific compliment]. Would you be interested in hunting InvoiceFlow?

Quick demo: [link to live product]
Key differentiator: Speed over features

No worries if you're busy - just thought it might resonate with makers who hate software bloat.

Best,
Josh
